      <p>Nature is the physical world that surrounds us, including all living and non-living things. It encompasses everything from the smallest microorganisms to the vast expanse of the universe. Nature is a source of inspiration, beauty, and wonder. It provides us with the resources we need to survive and thrive, such as food, water, and shelter. It also plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate and ecosystems.</p>

      <h2>HACKS TO SAVE NATURE</h2>
      <div class="textBg">
      <p>There are many ways to protect nature and preserve it for future generations. Here are some things you can do to help:
1. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**: Reduce waste and save money by minimizing the amount of items you use. Ensure items are used for as long as possible by reusing them and recycle whenever possible.
2. **Plant Trees**: Trees provide shade, eliminate the need for air conditioning, and are used in the paper industry. You can save trees by maximizing the use of your paper, such as printing or writing on both sides.
3. **Conserve Water**: Water conservation is vital since we cannot survive without water. You can minimize water wastage by reducing shower duration, turning off the tap while brushing your teeth or shaving, using a dishwasher, fixing leaking pipes, and using low-flow showerheads.
4. **Limit Car Use**: You can substitute your car for alternative methods such as biking, walking, and public transport. This reduces the emission of greenhouse gases which are responsible for climate change.
5. **Be a Green Gardener**: Use peat-free compost and natural fertilizers and pesticides. Plant native species and be kind to all the insects and birds that feed on flower nectar.</p>

      <h2>WHY NATURE IS IMPORTANT</h2>
      <div class="textBg">
      <p>Nature is important for human health in many ways. Being in nature, or even viewing scenes of nature, reduces anger, fear, and stress and increases pleasant feelings¬π. Exposure to nature not only makes you feel better emotionally, it contributes to your physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones¬π. Spending time in nature is linked to both cognitive benefits and improvements in mood, mental health and emotional well-being¬π. Feeling connected to nature can produce similar benefits to well-being, regardless of how much time one spends outdoors¬π. Both green spaces and blue spaces (aquatic environments) produce well-being benefits¬π.

Nature is also essential for our survival. We depend on biodiversity in the natural world for the water we drink, the food we eat and the clean air we breathe‚Å¥. Nearly 75% of all approved medical drugs come from nature and we rely on the biodiversity of plants and animals to find new medicines‚Å¥. Much of the world‚Äôs fresh water is provided from forests. The diversity of organisms in forests also clean and filter water‚Å¥.

In summary, nature is important for human health in many ways. It provides us with essential resources, improves our physical and mental well-being, and connects us to the natural world üåøüå∏üå≥.</p>
